## About

**Robots** is a plugin for **[Rhino's](https://www.rhino3d.com/)** **Grasshopper** visual programming interface. It allows users to create and simulate robot programs for **ABB**, **KUKA**, **UR**, **Staubli**, **Doosan**, and **Franka Emika** robots. It works in **Rhino 7** and **8** for **Windows** and **MacOS**.

## Install

> If upgrading from an old version check [here](../../../wiki/home#Upgrading-from-an-older-version).

1. Install in **Rhino 7** or **8** using the `_PackageManager` command, search for `Robots`.   
1. Restart **Rhino** and open **Grasshopper**. There should be a new tab in **Grasshopper** named `Robots`.
1. Install a robot library by clicking on the `Libraries` button of a `Load robot system` component.
   > The robots from the library should appear in a **value list** connected to a `Load robot system` component.
1. Read the [docs](../../../wiki) for more info.
1. Check the [samples](../samples/).
   > When opening a sample file, a dialog box might pop up with an assembly not found message. You can close this without fixing the path, it will automatically get fixed after the sample file is loaded.
